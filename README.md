# SoftwareSecurityCS305

For this project I will be working as a developer for a software engineering company, Global Rain, that specializes in custom software design and development. The software is for entrepreneuurs, buisnesses, and government agencies around the world. At Global Rain, I will be working with a client, Artemis Financial, a consulting company that develops individualzed financial plans for their customers. These plans includes savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. 

My job will be to protect Global Rain's client data and finacial information. I will be adding a file verification step to their web application to ensure secure communications. I will be examining Atemis Financial's software to address any security vulnerabilities. 

I will also recommend an appropriate encryption algorithm cipher to deploy, given the security vulnerabilities, and justify my reasoning behind it.  

The algirthm cipher I reccomended is the SHA-256 since it avoids collisions and keeps everything secure against attackers and it is the most secure cipher.
